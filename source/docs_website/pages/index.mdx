# Prfs

Prfs is a software-as-a-service enabling users and businesses to easily benefit from **client-side
verifiable computing**.

[Verifiable computing](/verifiable_computing) is a cryptographic method for an agent to argue that 
she knows all the values to be calculated leading up to the solution of a **mathematical 
function**. Values that are submitted as part of an argument are compressed and encrypted so that 
verifiers **cannot obtain more knowledge** other than if the argument is valid.

Depending on the choice of a *function*, it opens up a possibilitiy of some unseen behaviors of an 
agent. Whether an individual or institution, an agent can say, for example,

- I know the password of an account (without revealing the password)
- I processed a long sequence of data and the aggregated result is this. (computation
outsouring)
- I am someone in the qualified group (without revealing who exactly she is)

Interesting as it seems, such mathematical proofs don't get created as fast as we imagine
especially in a consumer grade machine, Speed aside, it entails mathematical concepts that are not 
readily comprehensible.

Prfs is designed to abstract away the **mathematical inner workings** of such a cryptographic
primitive and runs **reasonably fast** in the client side. 

In this documentation, we will walk you through the core concepts and functionalities Prfs provide.

## Applications
