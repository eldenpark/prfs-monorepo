Now you need to set up **inputs** to the proof. These inputs, also called `witness`, are usually 
known only to you, the prover. They will be **encrypted** while creating a proof and viewers of the 
proof would have no idea what the inputs would have been. There are inputs that are revealed to the
public on purpose and we call them **public inputs**.

Complete the following steps.

1. Type anything in `Hash data` field. This value will be encoded to a number and then will be fed
into a hash function.
2. Click `Hash` blue button to get encode the value.
3. Click `Create` button to start creating the proof.

Click `next`.
