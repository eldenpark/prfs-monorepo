Within a few seconds, you should be able to create a proof. Note that this process has been done 
in your own machine.

If you open a **verify tab** by clicking `verify` button, you will see public inputs and proof.
`msgHash` of public inputs is the result of a hash function with the argument you have given in
the previous step. (You were able to see this value by clicking `Hash` button in the previous 
step)

Proof is a large random-looking number that reveals nothing about the private inputs (msgRaw). It 
is, however, so meticulously calculated that only a slight change of the digit will break the 
verification process. 

1. Click **verify** button at the bottom to see if the proof is verified as valid.

Click next to see how you can share the proof.
