Within a few seconds, you should be able to create a proof. Note that this process has been done 
in your own machine.

If you open a **verify tab** by clicking `verify` button, you will see public inputs and proof.
`msgRaw` of public inputs is an argument to a hash function that is hard to "backward-calculate". 
Check to see if `msgRaw` of public inputs is the same as you typed while creating a proof.

``

Proof is a large random-looking number that revelas nothing about the inputs (msgRaw). It is, 
however, so meticulously calculated that only a slight change of the digit will break the 
verification process. 

1. Click **verify** button at the bottom to see if the proof is verified as valid.
