A proof can be shared by directly copy-pasting the value and send it over to the audience you want 
to convince.

However, that is far from ideal in terms of user experience. We instead suggest that you upload
the proof to some safe remote locations and then share the URL to the resource.

Such safe locations may include a decentralized file storage, or distributed ledger, but in this
case, we also encourage you to upload it to our own platform **Prfs** to streamline the process. 

Note that even if an access to the proof is centrally (or quasi-centrally) governed, proof itself 
will not be decipherable.
