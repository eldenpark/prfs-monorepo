# Prfs documentation (in-construction)

Prfs is a general-purpose interface for creating and verifying zero-knowledge proofs in the 
client-side.

Zero-knowledge proof is a technique being developed and actively investigated from a branch of 
study called Verifiable computing.

[Verifiable computing](/verifiable_computing) seeks a cryptographic method for an agent to argue 
that she has done certain computation correctly. In addition to proving that one has done the
computation, it also allows to hide the computational detail of the operation including a part or
all of the inputs that were used for the computation.

Depending on the choice of a *program*, it opens up a possibility of making an argument such as the
following. 

- I know the password of an account (account ownership verification without revealing secret)
- I processed a long sequence of data and the processed result is this. (computation
outsouring)
- I am someone in the qualified group (without revealing who exactly she is)

Interesting as it seems, such mathematical proofs cannot be made as fast as we imagine
especially in a consumer-grade machine. And, it entails mathematical concepts that are not 
readily comprehensible.

Prfs is designed to abstract away the **mathematical inner workings** of such cryptographic
primitives and conduct the task of creating a proof **reasonably fast** in the client side. 

In this document, we will go through the theoretical underpinning of the noble technology, how and
why Prfs works.
