# Getting started with proof creation

In this tutorial, we will show you how to create a proof of `Simple Hash` type. Click 'next' when
you are done with each step and follow the blue
dots. <span className={styles.blueDot}></span>

With `Simple Hash`, you want to prove you know the argument 'x' to a hash function y=h(x). Hash
function in this context usually refers to one that is not invertible (one-way).

E.g., f(x) = 13^x mod 11, where mod is remainder operation

Getting f(2) = 4 is trivial. But if we ask f^-1(y) = 8, the argument that makes the result 8,
it's not so obvious how we would obtain the solution, which is 3.

1. Now, let's open the search bar and pick `Simple Hash`. 

Click `next` once you are done.
