Proof generation should happen in a safe and isolated environment. We therefore move to a dedicated
web document space by clicking the **Create proof** button.

## Navigate to Prfs Id

You will have a popup window in your browser. Sign up if you haven't registered already or sign in.

After signing in, **proof generate form** should be ready. You need to configure **inputs** to the 
proof. These inputs, also called `witness`, are usually known only to you, the prover. They will 
be **encrypted** while creating a proof and viewers of the proof would have no idea what the 
inputs would have been. There are, however, inputs that are **revealed** to the public on purpose 
and we call them **public inputs**.

Complete the following steps.

1. Type anything in `Hash data` field. This value will be encoded to a number and then will be fed
into a hash function.
2. Click `Hash` blue button to create a value. `Msg hash` will appear in the bottom as you click 
the button.
3. Click `Submit` button to start creating the proof and navigate back to the host (Prfs) page.

Click `next`.
