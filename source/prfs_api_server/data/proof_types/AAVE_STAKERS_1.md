Proves one is the liquid stakers on Aave

## What is Aave?

Aave is a decentralised non-custodial liquidity market protocol where users can participate as
suppliers or borrowers. Suppliers provide liquidity to the market to earn a passive income, while
borrowers are able to borrow in an overcollateralised (perpetually) or undercollateralised
(one-block liquidity) fashion.

Aave Protocol has been audited and secured. The protocol is completely open source, which allows
anyone to interact with a user interface client, API or directly with the smart contracts on the
Ethereum network. Being open source means that you are able to build any third-party service or
application to interact with the protocol and enrich your product.
