Prove you are one of the holders of BAYC tokens

## Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC)

BAYC is a collection of 10,000 Bored Ape NFTsâ€”unique digital collectibles living on the Ethereum
blockchain. Your Bored Ape doubles as your Yacht Club membership card, and grants access to
members-only benefits, the first of which is access to THE BATHROOM, a collaborative graffiti
board. Future areas and perks can be unlocked by the community through roadmap activation.

Each Bored Ape is unique and programmatically generated from over 170 possible traits, including
expression, headwear, clothing, and more. All apes are dope, but some are rarer than others.

The apes are stored as ERC-721 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain and hosted on IPFS.
(See Record and Proof.) Purchasing an ape costs 0.08 ETH.

To access members-only areas such as THE BATHROOM, Apeholders will need to be signed into their
Metamask Wallet.
