## Ethereum

Ethereum is a network of computers all over the world that follow a set of rules called the
Ethereum protocol. The Ethereum network acts as the foundation for communities, applications, o
rganizations and digital assets that anyone can build and use.

You can create an Ethereum account from anywhere, at any time, and explore a world of apps or
build your own. The core innovation is that you can do all this without trusting a central
authority that could change the rules or restrict your access.
